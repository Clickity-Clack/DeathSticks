-HostScreen only uses one character for all clients (cuz you're using localHost ya dingus)
-sometimes server doesn't respond to jump command
-clients can't switch weapons
-bullets contact characters twice, dealing double damage??
-there's no way to remove a player from the game
-can get past killer bottom
sumething is weird with the shouldTextBeBlack calculations in Meter
