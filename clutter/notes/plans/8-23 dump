What's the deal?
I want to implement explosives
How do you get there?
Make a projectile that spawns an explosion on death
How do you plan to implement it?
I was thinking about making a subclass of projectile called explosiveProjectile, but I realized there isn't really anything about the projectile class that could be specialized specifically for projectiles that spawn things on death, which made me vaugely uncomfortable with the system I have in place. I don't know what to do with that feeling of vague discomfort, but perhaps it's time to implement a duct-tape solution and move on

Should that information be consolidated into the object?
What information is there?
-thing to be spawned
-where it needs to end up in the Game
-whether it hurts the character

Observations: we should move the contact method to the projectile, and have the projectile call the character's ouch method

What could affect the chain of logic for a whether a projectile does damage to a character?
-Perhaps enable friendly fire
-affect the health past the armor
-affect the health and armor in ratios
*I feel like too significant an adjustment of the mechaincs should be a decision reserved for game design, but it could pay off to think about how we may want to implement such features in the future
Too general an idea of what could be done requires that the objects have total access to eachother. that's bad design.
Okay, I think this may be a sign that I need to try just moving forward


Deadification:
Object type?
Spawn?
Respawn?
