refactoring necromancer- How do we want to deserialize info?
-Users should not need to modify it to add modded maps, weapons, weapon skins, character skins, sounds, victory
-Should be secure, such that it's impossible to mess with the end user's machine, or execute arbitrary code
-Protocol for adding new in-game objects?(e.g. )
-mark object as dead to confirm dead to prevent event spamming? [also, how to prevent event spamming?]

Actually, it looks like Necromancer should work just fine... Nice!

Next steps: make weapons + map interpreted- We're pretty mucn halfway there!
